The mission of the project is to identify the important clause and generate
a summary of a legal contract as per the prompt. Overall, the output of Smart
Contract Analysis model can be a helpful tool for lawyers, companies, and
researchers.

DATASET
We are using the data from CUAD(Contract Understanding Atticus
Dataset), which has around 13000 labels and approximately 500 commercial legal
contracts with various types of 41 legal clauses which are considered to be
important in reviewing the contracts.

ANALYSIS
When the user prompts his contracts, initially we will identify the
important clauses in the contract and then we will try to classify the clauses into
different types and then generate the summaries.
As a part of our analysis, we will be using decision trees for extracting the
information from the contracts and various types of NLP techniques to identify
important clauses, classify clauses into types and to generate the summaries of
contract.
