"Ames Real Estate Associates" (AREA) sought to increase their capacity for price forecasting and pinpoint the elements that are most likely to drive up the value of the residences that their clients are looking to sell. For this project, a data set records information regarding 2930 properties in Ames, Iowa, and the goal is to predict the selling price of a given house.

Homeowner might have a list of needs and wants for their new home, but everything comes down to the value they will receive for their money while making any transaction. Several factors affect the final selling price of a house, from the number of bedrooms to the property’s location. Identifying the underlying patterns of house price changes and predicting a selling price for the house can help homeowners immensely during the process. This paper will examine the Ames housing dataset using prediction models (a method used to find anomalies, patterns, and associations in data sets to predict the future).The initial processing of the data also revealed chunks of missing values and a few outliers; thus, we can develop synthetic data or assume a value or range which could affect the final results’ accuracy. By using predictive modeling, we will be answering the following questions by the end of this report:
1. How much is a house likely to sell for?
2. What elements affect the cost of a house?
3. What elements are more crucial than others?
4. What amount should the homeowner spend on house upgrades to boost the anticipated price by an amount greater
than the cost of the improvements?
5. Which houses should the homeowner consider as comparisons for theirs?
6. During what season should the homeowner list their house for sale?
